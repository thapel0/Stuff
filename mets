Scenario:
Given a data object like the one below, write a function named days_between that returns the number of days between the "end_date" and "start_date". In the example below, the function would return 8 as the number of days between "3/19/2021" and "3/27/2021".

Example Dataset:

data = {
    "dataset": {
        "id": 42,
        "frequency": "daily",
        "type": "Time Series",
        "date_range": {
            "start_date": "3/19/2021",
            "end_date": "3/27/2021"
        }
    }
}

Hint: You can use the Python datetime module to calculate the time delta between two dates.
